There are some images in our notebook file therefore, please create a folder that name is 'NotebookImages' in the Jupyter Notebook and put all the images inside of it.

Also, we have saved our models into the saved_models folder, that's why before running the notebook please add this folder into your Jupyter Notebook.

Finally, please add the CSV_files folder to your Jupyter Notebook before running our notebook file.

Thank you!
